    to be performed. The details of constructing a formula are
    described below.
  }

  \item{data}{
    an optional data frame, list or environment (or object
    coercible to a data frame by \code{\link{as.data.frame}}) containing the variables
    in the model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from
    \code{environment(formula)}, typically the environment from which the

  }

  \item{na.action}{
    a function which indicates what should happen when the data contain
   \code{NA}s. The default is set by the \code{\link{na.action}} setting of options, and is

\details{
  \code{npksum}
  exists so that you can create your own kernel objects with
  or without a variable to be weighted (default \eqn{Y=1}). With the options
  available, you could create new nonparametric tests or even new kernel
  estimators. The convolution kernel option would allow you to create,
  say, the least squares cross-validation function for kernel density
  estimation.
  
  \code{npksum} uses highly-optimized C code that strives
  to minimize its \sQuote{memory footprint}, while there is low overhead
  involved when using repeated calls to this function (see, by way of
  illustration, the example below that conducts leave-one-out
  cross-validation for a local constant regression estimator via calls
  to the \code{R} function \code{\link{nlm}}, and compares this to the
  \code{\link{npregbw}} function).

  \code{npksum} implements a variety
  of methods for computing
  multivariate kernel sums (\eqn{p}-variate) defined over a set of possibly
  continuous and/or discrete (unordered, ordered) data. The approach is
  based on Li and Racine (2003) who employ \sQuote{generalized product kernels}
  that admit a mix of continuous and discrete data types.

  Three classes of kernel estimators for the continuous data types are
  available: fixed, adaptive nearest-neighbor, and generalized
  nearest-neighbor. Adaptive nearest-neighbor bandwidths change with
  each sample realization in the set, \eqn{x_i}{x[i]}, when estimating the
  kernel sum at the point \eqn{x}. Generalized nearest-neighbor bandwidths change
  with the point at which the sum is computed, \eqn{x}. Fixed bandwidths
  are constant over the support of \eqn{x}.

  \code{npksum} computes
  \eqn{\sum_{j=1}^{n}{W_j^\prime Y_j K(X_j)}}{sum(t(W[j]) \%*\% Y[j] *
  K(X[j]))}, where \eqn{A_j}{A[j]} represents a row vector extracted
  from \eqn{A}.
  That is, it computes the kernel 
  weighted sum of the outer product of the rows of \eqn{W} and \eqn{Y}. In the
  examples, the uses of such sums are illustrated.

  \code{npksum} may be invoked \emph{either} with a formula-like
  symbolic 
  description of variables on which the sum is to be
  performed \emph{or} through a simpler interface whereby data is passed
  directly to the function via the \code{txdat} and \code{tydat}
  parameters. Use of these two interfaces is \bold{mutually exclusive}.

  Data contained in the data frame \code{txdat} (and also \code{exdat})
  may be a mix of continuous (default), unordered discrete (to be
  specified in the data frame \code{txdat} using the \code{\link{factor}} command),
  and ordered discrete (to be specified in the data frame \code{txdat}
  using the \code{\link{ordered}} command). Data can be entered in an arbitrary
  order and data types will be detected automatically by the routine
  (see \code{\link{np}} for details).

  Data for which bandwidths are to be estimated may be specified
  symbolically. A typical description has the form \code{dependent data
  ~ explanatory data},
  where \code{dependent data} and \code{explanatory data} are both
  series of variables specified by name, separated by 
  the separation character '+'. For example, \code{ y1 ~ x1 + x2 }
  specifies that \code{y1} is to be kernel-weighted by \code{x1} and 
  \code{x2} throughout the sum. See below for further examples. 

  A variety of kernels may be specified by the user. Kernels implemented
  for continuous data types include the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth
  order Gaussian and Epanechnikov kernels, and the uniform
  kernel. Unordered discrete data types use a variation on Aitchison and
  Aitken's (1976) kernel, while ordered data types use a variation of the
  Wang and van Ryzin (1981) kernel (see \code{\link{np}} for details).

\section{Usage Issues}{
  If you are using data of mixed types, then it is advisable to use the
  \code{\link{data.frame}} function to construct your input data and not
  \code{\link{cbind}}, since \code{\link{cbind}} will typically not work as
  intended on mixed data types and will coerce the data to the same
  type.
