5. Testing:

From inside your DOS command shell, now navigate where your test R
code (called it “mytest.R”) is located (along with the .Rprofile
file). At the command prompt, write

mpiexec –n 2 R –no-save –q < mytest.R > mytest_OUT.txt

Open “mytest_OUT.txt” using notepad or any other text editor and check
