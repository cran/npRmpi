These are based on those given in http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/yu/Rmpi/

1) Create the folder "R_temp" in your C:\ drive.

2) Download the following files and place then in "C:\R_temp" (note
   version numbers may be more recent so use the most recent
   available):

R-2.11.0-win32.exe         http://www.r-project.org/
Rtools211.exe              http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/
mpich2-1.2.1p1-win-ia32    http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich2
npRmpi_0.30-9.tar.gz       http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/npRmpi/index.html
test.R                     http://www.economics.mcmaster.ca/faculty/racinej
.Rprofile                  http://www.economics.mcmaster.ca/faculty/racinej

 * If you have problems dowloading this file in MS Windows, a local
   copy will be located in "C:\R_Temp\npRmpi\inst" (See step 3-(i)
   below) that you can freely move to your working directory (see note
   (i) at the bottom of this document)

3) Install the following programmes (in this order) using the default
   directories:

  (i) R-2.11.0-win32.exe (Please kindly refer to installation
      instructions at http://www.r-project.org/)

 (ii) Rtools211.exe (Please kindly refer to installation instructions
      at http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/)

(iii) mpich2-1.2.1p1-win-ia32 (Please kindly refer to installation
      instructions at
      http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/yu/Rmpi/windows.htm)

4) Untar npRmpi_0.30-9.tar.gz in the "C:\R_temp" folder.

  * To 'untar' in MS Windows, please download & install the following
    freeware programme: 7-zip (http://www.7-zip.org)

5) 'Open a command window here' (google this phrase if you don't know
    how) in "C:\R_Temp\" and type:

  R CMD INSTALL npRmpi

6) To test your installation now type:

  mpiexec -n 2 R --no-save -q < test.R > test_np_2.txt

7) Now open test_np_2.txt and if you find no errors, your installation
   has been successful!

Notes:

  (i) If you are planning to run R programmes in other folders that
      use the npRmpi package, simply make sure that the file .Rprofile
      is always located in the same folder as the programme you are
      trying to run, otherwise it will not work.

 (ii) The command 'mpiexec' is available only when the proper
      installation of mpich2-1.2.1p1-win-ia32 is performed. 
      Kindly refer to
      http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/yu/Rmpi/windows.htm for
      step-by-step instructions.
